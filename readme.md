1. Completed reading through the HOTPOT QA main paper and understood the baseline model architecture
2. We were able to re-create the baseline results in AGAVE cluster. model.pt file is uploaded in a release of 
   this repo. F1 score of 56.5 is obtained. For results please look into the screenshots posted in the baseline sub-directory
3  We tried to re-create the DFGN model. Though we are done with the pre-processing part, we are figuring it why it performed better than HotpotQA.
4. We also sampled the dataset and used google colab to run the baseline model. Though we have done analysis on full dataset using AGAVE, we got idea how to use colab for smaller dataset analysis and we would use it for future work.

Future Work:

1. We would continue working with DFGN and other models which have performed better than HotpotQA.
2. We are currently reading theory about hugging face transformers and looking into the github repo(https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)for the same. Discussing ideas about how to implement a hugging face transformer model to our dataset.
